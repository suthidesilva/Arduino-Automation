# Arduino-Automation
•	Designed and implemented a web-based control system for a Celestron telescope using Arduino UNO and integrated Bluetooth 5.0 and WiFi modules.
•	Created a real-time, bidirectional communication framework between the telescope hardware and web browser, utilizing ArduinoWebsockets and ESP8266/ESP32 libraries for efficient data transfer.
•	Automated calibration processes, including flats and switch control, to streamline observation setups and improve research efficiency.
•	Developed robust C++ code to manage HTTP requests and WebSocket connections, resolving bandwidth incompatibilities and ensuring system stability during extended operations.
•	Conducted risk assessments and devised failure management protocols to address potential hardware crashes and software disruptions.
•	Demonstrated the project’s applications in astronomical research, providing an accessible and scalable solution for remote observatory management.
